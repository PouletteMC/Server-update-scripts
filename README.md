# Easily update my minecraft servers
This script was created to easily update my minecraft servers. 
It can update both the server's JAR and its plugins.
It is limited to specific computers at the time as the paths are hard coded...


## Updating the JAR

I use Paper for all of my servers and Waterfall for the proxy. As such I can download the latest JAR using the API ! 
It is stored for then copied over to every server selected.


## Updating the Plugins

To update most of the plugins I use Spiget as the API. So the plugin is downloaded and copied over to the desired servers.

When it comes to Plan I had to improvise a little bit and use the dev's makeshift API. But hey ! it works ;)
